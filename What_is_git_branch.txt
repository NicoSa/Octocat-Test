If you initialize a new Git repository everything will be on the master branch, this a naming convention. Let´s say you develop your program further and further and at sometime you decide you want to try some new features but want to make sure your current version stays the way it is. Or even if you work on a project with others as collaborators and you want the new features separated from your current stable version of the program. This is when it is very handy to create a new branch. If your master branch is your main timeline, then branches are infinite parallel dimension versions of your repo in which your program can be modified completely. If at some point you decide one of your branches/alternative universes/alternative versions of your program(all the same thing) are superior to your master branch/main timeline you can merge those branches into one. It´s like hopping around between different dimensions that represent alternative versions of your program. Be creative, do whatever you like in your branches, no harm done to your stable master timeline. You or your program won´t disappear like in Back to the Future or something.
