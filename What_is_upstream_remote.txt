If you fork a repository it´s very likely that you´re not a collaborator on the project you forked, therefore you won´t see any changes in the original repository from your forked local repo UNLESS you set up an upstream remote. The word upstream is really just a convention that means you´re setting a second remote upstream in your local forked repo that allows you to fetch any changes from the original repo you forked into. This way you can stay up to date with the current original repo and set your pull up requests accordingly..
